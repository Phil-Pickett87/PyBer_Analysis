# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
  The purpose for this revised analysis is to clearly show the the results of the data for each city type's usage of ride sharing. In this summary we will breakdown the data and show how things like number of fares, number of drivers, and many other factors contribute to the success of the ride sharing app!
  
  ## Results 
  In order to understand the usage of the ride sharing app, we need to look at the types of areas that are using it! In order to do this, we've broken the city types into "Urban”, “Suburban", and "Rural". Our final data chart contains all the data for the months of January through April for 2019.
  
  * Urban: Being that Urban cites are the most densely populated, it’s no surprise that a majority of the total rides and total drivers were located there. Urban cities are usually easier to navigate and tend to attract more residents that may not have their own vehicle and as a result, they need to rely on ride sharing to get around. Urban cities also generally offer fun night life and activities that people will need a reliable source of transportation for in order to enjoy. All these factors make it easy to see why ride sharing is popular in urban environments. Perhaps less obvious is that the "average fare per ride" was the lowest in all city types. This could be due to shorter rides, more available drivers, or certain discounts offered in higher populated areas in order to attract more riders!
  
  * Suburban: Suburban cities scored second in every category and it makes sense that that is the case. Suburban areas are more sprawling, tend to house more families, and generally are less walkable that urban areas. These factors all contribute to a higher percentage of vehicle ownership among residents. That being the case there is less of a demand for ride sharing vehicles, and thus less ride sharing activity. An interesting point of the data however is that while suburban cities had only 625 rides compared to the 1,625 urban rides; the total suburban fares equaled 49% of the total city fares! With the number of suburban fares making up only 38% of urban fares, we can see there is a significantly higher average fare rate!
  
  * Rural: It seems obvious from the breakdown that rural areas are the least active when it comes to ride sharing. Rural areas tend not produce much ride sharing activity simply because there is a low demand for it. Many residents in rural areas own their own vehicles and there tends to be less things to attract visitors that would have to rely on ride sharing as a way to get around. That’s not to say there is zero activity in rural areas, from this data we see that there were actually 125 rides as well as 78 active drivers.

  ## Summary
  In conclusion we can see that the breakdown of usage makes sense when we consider the populations of the areas we're looking at. The more densely populated areas have a much higher demand for ride sharing transportation while the more rural communities tend not to need is regularly. I believe moving forward, we should look to expand our business in Suburban cities. I believe there is a larger market there than in Rural cities and that the demand given slightly cheaper rates will go up. As we can see from the data the Urban numbers are fairly strong, but they can always be better. Offering deals and reduced rates during slower times like the weekday afternoons may help increase rider count. Contrast increasing prices during busy times like holidays when travel is up, or late night on the weekends when bars and restaurants close, could be a good way to increase the overall fares! The level of success of ride sharing heavily depends upon supply and demand, as a result the better services and the more availability we offer riders, the higher the demand will be!
